st.subheader("What is a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM)?")
st.markdown("""
Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are visual tools that help you model how different concepts influence each other in a complex system. 
Theyâ€™re especially useful when:
- The relationships are uncertain or subjective
- You're thinking about change over time
- You want to simulate how changes in one area might affect others

In this tool, you'll define a mental landscape, organize concepts into categories, link them, and simulate how they interact.
""")

# You can now continue the rest of your app logic using `preset_nodes` and `preset_edges` if a scenario is selected.
# These variables can be used to pre-populate the node list and edge list, and users can then further refine or simulate.
